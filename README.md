<h3>What is RISC-V?</h3>
<p>RISC-V is an exciting and innovative open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that enables developers to create custom processors tailored to specific applications. This means that anyone can design and implement their processors without needing to pay for expensive licenses, making RISC-V a popular choice in both academia and industry.</p>


<h2>Instruction Formats in RISC-V</h2>
RISC-V organizes its machine language instructions into six distinct formats, each optimized for different types of operations. Here’s a breakdown of each format:

<h3>R-Type Instructions:</h3>

<p>Used primarily for arithmetic and logical operations.Each instruction is 32 bits long and includes.<br>
 Structure:
<li>Opcode (7 bits): Indicates the type of operation.</li>
<li>rd (5 bits): The destination register where the result is stored.</li>
<li>func3 (3 bits): Specifies the operation type (e.g., add, subtract).</li>
<li>rs1 (5 bits): The first source register.</li>
<li>rs2 (5 bits): The second source register.</li>
<li>func7 (7 bits): Provides additional details about the operation.</li></p>

<h3>I-Type Instructions:</h3>
Involves operations that use registers and immediate values (constants).<br>
Structure:
<li>Opcode (7 bits): Identifies the instruction type.</li>
<li>rd (5 bits): The destination register.</li>
<li>func3 (3 bits): Operation type.</li>
<li>rs1 (5 bits): The source register.</li>
<li>imm (12 bits): A signed immediate value (replaces rs2 and func7 from R-Type).</li>

<h3>S-Type Instructions:</h3>
Used to store data from registers to memory.<br>
Structure:
<li>Opcode (7 bits): Indicates the operation.</li>
<li>imm (12 bits): Split into two parts for memory address calculation.</li>
<li>rs1 (5 bits): The source register containing the value to be stored.</li>
<li>func3 (3 bits): Defines the type of store operation (byte, half-word, etc.).</li>

<h3>B-Type Instructions:</h3>
Used for branching and control flow based on conditions.<br>
Structure:
<li>Opcode (7 bits): Defines the instruction type.</li>
<li>imm (12 bits): Encodes the branch offset.</li>
<li>rs1 (5 bits) and rs2 (5 bits): Source registers used in the branching condition.</li>
<li>func3 (3 bits): Specifies the branch condition.</li>

<h3>U-Type Instructions:</h3>
Designed to load immediate values into registers.<br>
Structure:
<li>Opcode (7 bits): Specifies the instruction.</li>
Consists mainly of two instructions: LUI (Load Upper Immediate) and AUIPC (Add Upper Immediate to PC).
Example: lui x15, 0x13579 would load the value into the upper half of register x15.

<h3>J-Type Instructions:</h3>
It is used for jump operations, allowing the program to change its execution flow.<br>
Structure:
<li>Opcode (7 bits): Indicates a jump instruction.</li>
<li>imm (20 bits): The immediate value determining where to jump.</li>
Primarily consists of the JAL (Jump and Link) instruction, often used in loops and function calls.<br>

<h2>Exact 32-bit instruction code in the instruction type format for 15 unique instructions.</h2>


### 1. `lw x5, 0(x0)`  
   - **Instruction Type:** I-Type  
   - **Operation:** Load word from memory.  
   - **Details:**  
     - This instruction loads a 32-bit word from memory at the address specified by `x0 + 0` (which is typically `0` because `x0` in RISC-V is hardwired to zero).
     - The value from this memory location is loaded into the register `x5`.  
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - This is the first memory load operation and sets the value of `x5`.

---

### 2. `lw x6, 4(x0)`  
   - **Instruction Type:** I-Type  
   - **Operation:** Load word from memory.  
   - **Details:**  
     - Similar to the first instruction, but here it loads a word from an address offset by 4 bytes from the base address in `x0` (0 in this case).  
     - This value is loaded into register `x6`.
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - This instruction sets the value of `x6` from memory.

---

### 3. `lw x7, 8(x0)`  
   - **Instruction Type:** I-Type  
   - **Operation:** Load word from memory.  
   - **Details:**  
     - This instruction loads the word from the memory address `x0 + 8` and stores it into register `x7`.  
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - This instruction sets the value of `x7`.

---

### 4. `blt x5, x6, else1`  
   - **Instruction Type:** B-Type  
   - **Operation:** Branch if less than.  
   - **Details:**  
     - This is a conditional branch instruction.
     - It compares `x5` and `x6`. If the value in `x5` is less than the value in `x6`, the program branches to the label `else1`. If not, it continues with the next instruction.
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - This instruction controls the program flow by branching based on a comparison. It introduces the decision-making part of the program.

---

### 5. `mv x8, x5` (encoded as `addi x8, x5, 0`)  
   - **Instruction Type:** I-Type  
   - **Operation:** Move (implemented as `addi` with immediate 0).  
   - **Details:**  
     - The `mv` (move) instruction copies the value from `x5` to `x8`. It’s encoded as `addi x8, x5, 0`, which adds 0 to `x5` and stores the result in `x8`.  
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - This instruction is used to copy the value of `x5` into `x8`. If the program didn’t branch at `blt`, this would be the next step.

---

### 6. `j next1`  
   - **Instruction Type:** J-Type  
   - **Operation:** Jump to label.  
   - **Details:**  
     - This unconditional jump moves program execution to the label `next1`, skipping over any instructions between the current one and `next1`.
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - It skips some instructions (likely the `else1` block) and moves execution forward.

---

### 7. `mv x8, x6` (encoded as `addi x8, x6, 0`)  
   - **Instruction Type:** I-Type  
   - **Operation:** Move (implemented as `addi` with immediate 0).  
   - **Details:**  
     - Copies the value from `x6` to `x8`, similar to the earlier `mv` instruction, but now with the value of `x6`.  
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - This happens if the program took the `else1` branch, updating `x8` with the value from `x6`.

---

### 8. `blt x8, x7, else2`  
   - **Instruction Type:** B-Type  
   - **Operation:** Branch if less than.  
   - **Details:**  
     - This compares the value in `x8` with `x7`. If `x8` is less than `x7`, the program branches to `else2`. Otherwise, it continues with the next instruction.
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - Controls the flow based on another comparison. This adds another decision point in the program.

---

### 9. `mv x8, x7` (encoded as `addi x8, x7, 0`)  
   - **Instruction Type:** I-Type  
   - **Operation:** Move (implemented as `addi` with immediate 0).  
   - **Details:**  
     - Copies the value from `x7` to `x8`.  
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - If the program didn’t branch to `else2`, it moves the value of `x7` to `x8`.

---

### 10. `sw x8, 0(x10)`  
   - **Instruction Type:** S-Type  
   - **Operation:** Store word to memory.  
   - **Details:**  
     - This instruction stores the word from register `x8` into memory at the address `x10 + 0`.
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - It writes the result of the computation back to memory.

---

### 11. `ret` (encoded as `jalr x0, 0(x1)`)  
   - **Instruction Type:** I-Type (for indirect jumps).  
   - **Operation:** Return from subroutine.  
   - **Details:**  
     - This is a return instruction. It jumps back to the address stored in `x1` (typically the return address of a subroutine).
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - It ends the current function or subroutine and returns control to the calling program.

---

### 12. `nop` (encoded as `addi x0, x0, 0`)  
   - **Instruction Type:** I-Type  
   - **Operation:** No operation.  
   - **Details:**  
     - A `nop` (no operation) is a placeholder instruction that does nothing. It is encoded as `addi x0, x0, 0` which adds 0 to register `x0` (which remains 0).
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - It introduces a delay or alignment in instruction execution without affecting program state.

---

### 13. `lui x1, 0x1`  
   - **Instruction Type:** U-Type  
   - **Operation:** Load upper immediate.  
   - **Details:**  
     - This instruction loads the immediate value `0x1` into the upper 20 bits of register `x1`. The lower 12 bits are set to 0.  
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - It sets up `x1` with a high immediate value for future operations.

---

### 14. `addi x10, x0, 4`  
   - **Instruction Type:** I-Type  
   - **Operation:** Add immediate.  
   - **Details:**  
     - Adds the immediate value `4` to `x0` (which is 0) and stores the result (`4`) in `x10`.  
   - **Role in Program:**  
     - It sets `x10` to 4, possibly for future memory address calculations or comparisons.

		  <h3>MINI PROJECT</h3>
		  </summary>
<h2>Implementing Automatic Light System Using VSDSquadron Mini</h2>


<h3> Overview:</h3>
<p>This project involves creating an automatic lighting system that responds to motion, utilizing the VSDSquadron Mini board, an IR sensor, and LEDs. The system is designed to turn lights on when movement is detected and off when no movement is present, enhancing energy efficiency and convenience.</p><br>

<h3>Components:</h3>
<li><b>VSDSquadron Mini Board:</b> This microcontroller serves as the core unit that processes sensor input and controls the output to the lights via its GPIO pins.</li>
<li><b>IR Sensor:</b> It detects movement in the environment. When motion is detected, the sensor signals the VSDSquadron mini to activate the lights.</li>
<li><b>LEDs:</b> Used to represent the lighting system. These LEDs are connected to the GPIO pins of the VSDSquadron mini and are turned on or off depending on the IR sensor’s input.</li>
<li><b>Breadboard and Jumper Wires:</b> These components help in making connections between the sensor, microcontroller, and LEDs for easy prototyping.</li><br>
<h3>Functionality:</h3>
The IR sensor continuously monitors the environment for motion. When it detects movement, it sends a HIGH signal to the VSDSquadron mini via a GPIO pin.
The VSDSquadron mini, in turn, triggers the LEDs to switch on, simulating the activation of lights.
After a predetermined delay (e.g., 10-15 seconds), the LEDs turn off if no further motion is detected.
The system resets, ready to respond to the next motion event.<br>

<h3>Hardware connections:</h3>
<h4>PIN daigram.</h4>
<li><b>VSDSquadron Mini</b></li>
<b>Power:</b>
The board is powered via the USB connection to your computer or an external power source.
<li><b>GPIO Pins:</b></li>
GPIO Pin 1 → IR Sensor (OUT)<br>
GPIO Pin 2 → LED (with resistor)<br>
GPIO Pin 3 → Additional LED (optional for more lights)<br>
<li><b>IR Sensor</b></li>
VCC → 3.3V (from the VSDSquadron mini)<br>
GND → Ground (GND on VSDSquadron mini)<br>
OUT → GPIO Pin 1 (Input to VSDSquadron mini)<br>
<li><b>LEDs</b></li>
Anode (long leg) → GPIO Pin 2 (via 220Ω resistor)<br>
Cathode (short leg) → Ground (GND on VSDSquadron mini)<br>
